# Ecommerce
Good morning, good evening my friends.👋
 Do what God is always fine ❤.

 Today I finished the ECommerce website 🔥
 This time, I would not like to dwell on the details for you.

 Through the site, you can only buy a laptop. In some products, it is found on the home page, or you can search from the search page by name or through the filters that you like.

 You buy the product, then it goes to the basket, and then the process goes to the Owners. The status of the process is limited in terms of rejection, acceptance, reaching the customer, and so on.

 # The website consists of a number of pages such as:
 1- Dashboard
 - Dashboard.
 - Orders
 - Customers.
 - Products.

 2- Home
 - Home Page.
 - Product.
 - My Basket.
 - Last order.
 - Profile.
 - Search.

 # Types of permissions:
 1- Owner: He does everything 😃.
 2- Admin: Wadda Al-Bayaa.
 3- User: The normal user, who cannot access Dashboard.
